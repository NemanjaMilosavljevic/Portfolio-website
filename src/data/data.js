    firstDescription: `Libela Design Studio is a studio dedicated to good design, where modernity meets sophistication and elegance. It was founded in 2021, primarily oriented toward interior design and architectural visualization.\n\n After years of working in Visual and Graphic Design, and as I decided to fully prequalify myself last year in the field of Web and Product Design, Architectural Studio became Visual Design Studio. It now offers services such as Web Design, Product and UX/UI design, and also has a newbie coming this year, a small brand, named ГРИЗЛИ.\n\n This journey started with a wish to have my landing page designed by myself, but As I fell in love on that path with Web, Product, and Visual Design, I now want to help other Architects and Interior Designers to have beautifully created Landing pages and Portfolio websites, showcasing their design in the best way.`,
